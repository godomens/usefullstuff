      <h1>Useful Stuff</h1>
      <p class="intro">
        Hello! Here is a collection of a few useful things on different topics. All of the things you find here, I have tried out myself, they work and therefore have my approval!<br /><br />
        <strong>Note:</strong> Some of them are in another language than English. Just translate it with your browser or auto generated subtitles— it will work fine!
      </p>

      <section id="security">
        <h2>Security</h2>

        <h3>Password Manager</h3>
        <p class="inline-description">
          <a href="https://keepassxc.org/">KeepassXC</a>. It is a free open-source password manager. You will have to store the file on a cloud service like Dropxbox or Google Drive in order to use it across several devices. Unforntunately it
          does not work yet on Proton Drive. As the file itself is encrypted I do not worry so much about it and store it on Dropbox.
        </p>
        
        
       

        <h3>ProtonMail</h3>
        <p class="inline-description">
          I stepped over from Gmail to the Proton "universe". Like Google, Proton has its own privacy focused AI, Drive and Email. As they promise to not collect any data and sell or use it, you have of course to pay for it.
        You will find it here: <a href="https://proton.me/mail">Proton Mail</a>
       Remember: Nothing is free, you will "pay" them by giving them your data! Especially with AI, companies may one day be able to price-gouge products based on what they know you like! Think of travel routes, hobby products, clothing,
        everything!

        <h3>Realistic Painting</h3>
          <p class="inline-description">
            Visit the website <a href="https://www.drawmixpaint.com">drawmixpaint.com</a> for a complete realistic oil painting course. It is free! <br>
            <br>
            <b>Important:</b> I do NOT use any harmful spirits or oil paint like suggested in this course. I only use linseed oil (not refined!) and series 1 of Winsor and Newton. For prepping my canvas with burned siena I use watermixable oil paints. <br> <br>
            If you buy professional oil paint (higher seriesnumbers), you risk buying oil paints containing the "original/real" pigments, like cadmium, which are very toxic! 
            Always inform yourself beforehand by searching on the suppliers website for the SDS (safety data sheet) of your oil paint! <br><br>
            For some paintings I already switched to <b>watersoluble oil paints</b>, which are non toxic and very suitable for beginners! Highly recommend them! Any brand like Winsor and Newton Artisan, Cobra or Schmincke Norma is fine. 
          </p>
        
      
        
<h3>Abstract Painting</h3>

  <p class="inline-description">
  <a href="https://www.art2life.com/">Art2Life</a>
  is run by the artist Nicholas Wilton. You do not have to follow any of the paid courses,
  just join the free content and you will get a lot out of it. Knowledge comes in pieces
  (for example, weekly “Sunday Bloom” emails, which I highly recommend subscribing to),
  but it is worth it. Try to join the free online art events — they usually take place
  around march, june, and september.
  </p>





        
        <h3>Mixing Colors</h3>
        <p class="inline-description">
          For color mixing in general I suggest you first watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGMRrpYmsr8" >How to mix any color (no talent method) </a> 
          and then <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeyYXMl934g">How to mix any color</a>. They are pratically the same, but its very imporant to understand the concept, so I highly recommend you watching them both! All
          videos of Mark's channel are very helpful by the way! </p>

            Its worth the time, for the optimal taste experience the dough needs to have raising time and time in the fridge! You can also check out the official guidelines for pizzadough from Napoli
